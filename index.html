      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I’m Charina Mie Tulod, a fresh BSIT graduate eager to start my career in the tech industry. During my studies and internship, I trained in Salesforce Administration and built my skills in PHP, SQL, and JavaScript through hands-on projects. I enjoy solving problems, analyzing data, and helping people with technical support. I’m excited to gain real experience in web development, data analysis, or IT support, and to grow as a reliable and adaptable team member.</p>
